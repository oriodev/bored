// upgrades

// a standard multiplier for speed

// when does a circle unlock auto
// when does a circle unlock 


// so a circle is either locked/unlocked, auto/manual

// so we keep track of what upgrades each circle has unlocked -> it's just 1 number
// and then we add a multiplier to track by how much they grow
// OH AND COST
// for bigger circles, multipliers are smaller and costs are higher
// so each circle needs to have: multiplier, speed upgrades unlocked, and then speed = multiplier * speedupgrades

// okay, let's try and make this circle spin on it's own.
// so let's say, for now, it spins on it's own after 2 speed upgrades are unlocked
